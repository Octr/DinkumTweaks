# DinkumTweaks
A mod for Dinkum, adds new configuration options.

Hello ðŸ™‚ looking for mod users who are interested in testing an early preview of my current mod.

I mostly need feedback on the bugs/issues and such, and what does or doesn't work yet.

As with all mods please use with caution and make save backups if you need to!

This mod adds a range of custom tweaks to the game that are all configurable.
